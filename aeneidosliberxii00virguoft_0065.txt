ι l. infractos] ‘ broken‚’ i. e. in spirit, so that they ‘had
become faint-hearted ’ (dejecisse). adverso Marte ι i.e. by their
failure in the combat described in the last Book, during which
Camilla was slain.

2. sua] Emphatic by position, like se in the next clause:

often has this sense in composition3 cf. refer, 76, ‘duly
deliver' of a message, and reclclo commonly, e.g. of a postman
‘ deliveriug ' a letter. The ‘ promise ’ referred to is that made
by Turnus (ll. 438 seq.) of meeting Aeneas in single combat.

3. ultro] This word, connected with ultra, often describes
action which goes beyond what might be expected. Turnus
might be expected to share the depression of his fellow-
countrymen, but instead he ‘blazes out in fury unappeasable.
The word is variously rendered ‘of himself,' ‘of his own
accord,' ‘unprompted‚' or ‘at once‚' but there is no close
English equivalent. Cf. 61:311.

4. Poenorum] i.e. the Carthaginians. The lions of North
Africa were noted at Rome.

N OTES. 99

835. commixti ] ‘ The Trojans shall but sink blended in
the mass’3 they shall be incorporated and absorbed in the
native Italian race, but nothing more. This peculiar phrase
should be carefully compared with G. l. 327, massicus alit
τηαφιο commixtus corpore fetus, where Virgil is describing the
heaven (i.e. the rain) descending into the lap of earth, and
there disappearing ‘ commingled with its (the earth’s) mighty
frame,' while at the same time securing all fertility and
increase. So too the 'l‘rojans will disappear and be absol-bed
in the great Latin community which they join, and from this
happy 11111011 shall ‘arise a mixed race of Italian breed which
shall surpass men and surpass the gods in righteousness.’

Conington gives for subsident, ⁶ shall hold the lowest place‚’
and explains corpore tantum of the Trojans being ‘ mingled with
the Latius in body only, not 111 name‚' which Ι do not under-
stand.

836. morem... adiciam] Cf. 192. What Aeneas there pro-
poses to do Jupiter here declares to be his own purpose.

839. pietate] This is in Virgil the special Roman virtue. The
ideal Roman is vir pietate yram-11>- (l. 151), and it is as the type
of his race, not merely as the saviour of Anchises, that Aeneas
is everywhere pius. This word expresses dutiful regard for

. natural obligation either to the gods, kinsfolk, or country.

But as a man should show his regard 10 the gods, so they are
bound to show reeiprocal regard for him, and the pietas of the
gods is often referred to, e.g. 5. 688, 327 quid pietus antiqua
labores {respicit humanos. But the gods may fail in this
‘ righteous regard,' and hence to speak of the Romans ‘ex-
ceeding the gods' in it is a phrase not beyond the limits
of rhetorical amplification.

840. nec gens ..] She shared with Jupiter and Minerva
the great temple on the Capit013 as ι[11110 Beslhza she had
her own temple 011 the Aventine, and others asffzmo filonem,
ιῙτιηο Lucina, etc.

842. interea] ‘and so,³ i.e. while in this sostened mood.
For excedit caelo, cf. 791 n.

NOTES. 101

857. Parthus Parthus, sive cydon] virgil is fond of this
repetition of a word when he wishes to amplify an idea; cf.
674, turrimque tenebat, Ι turrim quae (then follows a fuller
(lescription); 897, sarcum vircwnspicit iugens, 1 saxum auli-
quum... . The men of Cydon in Crete were noted· archers,

cf. Ecl. 10. 59.

859. celeres transilit umbras] so 4. 226, 270, 357, celeres
per auras is used of Mercury flying swiftly through the air.
The air is imagined as swiftly passing by the object which
swiftly passes through it ; so we speak of objects ‘ flying past '
when we travel in an express. The repetition of celerem
(853), celeri (855), and celeres, here seems to show want of

- revision3 cf. 631 n.

861. uidet] i.e. comes in sight of.

862. alitis parvae] i.e. of an owl3 cf. 4. 4623 G. 1. 402.
parvae : ‘ small ' ; i.e. in comparison with the Fury's natural
size. collecta ι ‘ gathering herself together,’ ‘ shrinking.'

863. quondam] ‘at times‚' ‘ oft! Notice the alliteration in
quae quondam, sedens serum, which, together with the
spondaic ending culminibus desertis, is intended to suggest
awe and melancholy.

864. serum canit] ‘ sings late‚' :serum carmen canit, cf.
398 n. inportuna: cf. G. 1. 470, inportunaeque volucres, used of
birds of ill omen. The adj. is a very strong one, used strictly,
like inportuosus³ of a coast which has no harbours, and then:
‘ unseasonab1e‚’ ‘ utterly out of place,' ‘intolerable.'

869. stridorem et alas]:striclorem alarum3 she ‘recognizes
the whir of the Fury’s wings,’ cf. 876. For other instances of
hendiadys (ἓν διὰ δυοῖν), the figure by which two words or
phrases are simply put side by side, instead of a single com-
plex phrase in which the words qualify each other ; cf. 50. 508.

871. soror] added pleonastically to emphasize the cause of
her conduct—⁶ with a sister's sorrow.'

873. iam] emphatic ; ‘ now ’ = ‘ after this.’ durae : ‘ endur-
ing’3 she has borne everything for his sake, but now she
must yield to crushing destiny. For durus so used, cf. 3. 94,
Dardanidae dur& 5. 730, qens dura atque aspera cultu.
Conington strangely explains ‘obdurate,’ ‘hard-hearted‚' as
though she reproached herself with neglecting Turnus. It is
not her will but her power which is weak.

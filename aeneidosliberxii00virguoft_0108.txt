80 VERG. AEN. XII.

572. caput] i.e. the controlling central power; cf. Livy
26. 7, caput ipsum belli Roma-m petere, of Hannibal's design to
attack Rome. belli summa z the phrases summa belli, imperii,
consilii, rerum, etc, are common to denote the main or most

important part of ‘ a campaign‚' ‘a plan‚' etc„ as opposed to
minor details.

574. dixerat, atque dant] ‘ no sooner had he spoken than
they form.⁷ The change of tense from pluperfect to present (cf.
650) and the use of atque, which denotes close connection, mark
that their action follows immediately on the end of his speeche

578. ferrum torquent] ‘ hurl iron javelins.' obumbrant :
cf. the famous answer of Dieneces at Thermopylae, who, ,
when he was told that the Persian arrows would hide the sun,
replied that it was ‘ good to fight in the shade‚' Herod. 7. 226.

579. dextram ‚..tendit] graphic3 as he leads his men on
he waves the sword in his right hand towards the walls.

582. bis altera foedera] The making of the first treaty is
described in Book 7 ; it had been broken owing to the devices

of J uno, who (7. 324) sent the fury Allecto to cause dissension
between the Trojans and the Latius.

583. discordia] explained in the next three lines: some
wish to yield, others to fight.

585. ipsumque ] They ‘ seek to drag him to the walls ' in
order that he may there make terms with Aeneas. Notice
that trahunt does not imply that they succeeded in dragging

Latinus to the walls ; it merely describes an attempt (or only
a desire) to seize him and do so.

586. pergunt defendere] ⁴ press on to defend.' For the
infinitive cf. 60, desiste committere, ‘ cease joining’; 357,
luctatur eripere3 676, absiste morari. It is very common in
poetry after many verbs implying ‘ ability‚’ ‘ desire‚’ ‘ deter-
mination‚’ ⁶ neglect,’ etc, and is called epexegetic (cf. 527 n.),
because it ‘ fully explai11s‚' or prolative, because it ‘ extends‚'
the meaning of the verb.

587. From Apollonius Rhodius, 2. 130 :
ὼς δὲ μελισσάων σμῆνος μέγα μηλοβοτῆρες
ὴὲ μελισσοκόμοι πέτρῃ ἐνὶ καπνιόωσιν,
ἁὶ δή τοι τείως μὲν ἀολλέες ᾦ ἐνὶ σίμβλῳ
βομβηδὸν κλονέονται, ἐπιπρὸ δὲ λιγνύοεντι
καπνῴ τυφόμεναι πέτρης ἑκὰς ἀίσσουσιν.

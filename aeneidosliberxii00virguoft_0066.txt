38 VERG. AEN. XII,

look you, before hostile darts can pursue him, a wolf .⁵
The word also goes closely with sancius: it is ‘ when
wounded, look you’ and ‘then only' (tum demum) that the
lion attacks, just as Turnus is only stung to action by the
unspoken taunts of the Latius.

6. movet arma] ‘advances battle'3 a military phrase; cf.
Livy, 7. 29, adversus Samnites ...mota arma, ‘war was begun.’
comantes toros: ‘ the masses of his mane.' torus· (perhaps
from scernozscorns, or else from the same root as τύλος) is
commonly used of (l) a couch and (2) a bulging mass of
muscles, but can describe anything which ‘bulges' out, and
the adj. comantes here makes its meaning plain.

7. latronis] This word, which describes (1) a mercenary
soldier and (2), more usually, a brigand or assassin, is used
with a certain contempt, as though the lion scorned the

The pledge is the offer to meet Turnus made by Aeneas,
ll. 115-118. Sidgwick rightly says, “nihil est quod, ‘there
is no reason why,' quod being used relatively just as quid is
used interrogatively.''

13. congredior] stronger and more graphio than the future.
pater et: the final syllable of pater is lengthened by ictus, and,
possibly, also with some recollection of the original length of
the syllable, cf. πατήρ. So too 68, ebzir, auc ; 422, άοίόν, omnis ;

act. of verbs είαύᾶε ; huc ε 883, erit ’10. concipe foedus: ‘draw
up the compact’ (ef. Hamlet, 1. 1. 86 seq.). concipere is
technically used of ⁶ drawing up ’ something according to the

N OTES. 49

‘scaree had I spoken when all trembled.’ The clause cum
efflant describes the hour of dawn—‘ it was dawn, the time
when the sun’s steeds rise‚' etc.

115. lucemque...] The horses of the sun breath ‘fire’ or
‘light’3 cf. Pind. Ol. 7. 70, ὁ ’γενέθλιος ἀκτίνων πατήρ Ι πῦρ

πνεόντων ἀρχὸς ἵππων.

118. dis communibus] The ‘ common gods’ are the gods
whom they invoke in common to ratify their eompaet.

120. velati limo] All Mss. give lino, ‘ in linen,' but Servius
states that before his time eritics had pointed out that the
true reading was limo, and says that limus was an apron, so-
called from a eross-stripe of purple (purpura lima), used by
attendants on magistrates, ete, though Gellius derives the
word from its being worn ‘cross-wise.' virgil is very fond
of using arehaic and antiquarian words, and a rare word like
this would almost certainly be corrupted by copyists. For
tempora vincti see 172 n.

121. pilata] ‘densely-packed,’ and so in artistic eontrast
with se fimdmzt; the)v crush through the ‘crowded gates,'
and then spread out. Servius distinctly states that in Varro
pilatum aymen is=slensum agmen„ and quotes other writers
for the adverb pilatim used os marching ‘in close array.'
Otherwise we should be tempted to take the word, like
hastati, clipeati, ete.‚ as=‘armed with the pilum’ (as in
Mart. 10. 48. 2, pilata cohors, where see Friedlander), and
in that case too there would be an effective eontrast between
the javeline-bearing Italians and the host ‘of Trojans and
Etruseans with their varied weapons (i.e. each bearing their
national weapons).'

124. haud secus...] Virgil thus pointedly dwells on their
being armed because of the general fight which is going—to
break out ; see 266 seq.

126. volitant] ‘ move swiftly,' ‘ hasten hither and thither)

127. genus] So 7. 2133 Hor. Sat. l. 6. 12; 2. 5. 63, iuvenis
ab alto Ι demissum [renus Aeneas: ⁴ son’ or ‘ descendant ’3
and below 198, [lenus duplex, ‘ twin ehildren.²

128. equum] gen. plur., cf. 78 n.

46 VERG. AEN. XII.

83. Pilumno...] Orithyia was wife of Boreas, who in
Homer (Il. 20. 223) is the sire of the royal horses of Troy,
just as Zephyrus is of the divine horses of Achilles (ΙΙ. 16.
150), early mythology—by a very natural image—personify-
ing the winds as swift high-spirited steeds. Here Orithyia
presents some of these half-divine steeds to the Italian deity
Pilumnus, and he in turn bestows them on Turnus, who is
his grandson (10. 76) or great-grandson (10. 619), Pilumnus
is the brother of Picumnus (= Piens grandfather of Latinus,
7. 48).

34. qui ...] So of the horses of Rhesus, 11. 10. 437, λευκότεροι
χιόνος, θείειν δ’ ἀνέμοισιν ὁμοῖοι. The subj. qui...anteirent
probably because qui :quum ii: they were to be his pride
(decus), ⁴ seeing that they surpassed . .'

85. properi. aurigae] Homer's ὀτρηροί θεράποντες. mani-
busque : ‘and stir their mettle, patting their chests with
hollow palms.' In this intricate phrase Virgil takes advan-
tage of the double meaning of pectus, which may be (l) the
actual chest which is patted, or (2) the stout heart beneath it
which the patting animates3 cf. the common phrases forte,
animosum, certum pectus. Note the imitative alliteration in
line 86.

87. auro squalentem] ‘with scales of gold'; Virgil regu-
larly (cf. 8. 436; 9ς 707; 11. 488) uses squama of the
⁶ scales’ or single plates of scale-armour, and possibly thinks
of squaleo and squama as connected. In any case the idea
suggested is not of a fish's scales, but of a dragon's.
orichalco: ὀρείχαλκος, ‘mountain copper,' an unknown metal
resembling gold (hence often by false etymology written
aurichalcum), but perhaps paler3 cf. albo.

88. aptat habendo] ‘fits for handling’ or ‘wearing‚’ cf.
46 n. He tries the sword and shield to see whether they
exactly suit.

89. ensemqffe clipeumque] Cf. 181, fontesque fluviosq11oe3
363, Chloreaqzw Sybarimque; 443, Antheusque lllnestheusque‚
and elsewhere tribulaque traheaeque, aestusque fluviosque,
terrasque tractusque. Virgil is fond of thus beginning lines
in imitation of Homer's lengtheniug of τε in such phrases as
Λάμπον τε“ Κλύτιόν τε, Προδοήνωρ τέ Κλὺτιός τε. It will be
observed that the lengthened que is usually followed by two

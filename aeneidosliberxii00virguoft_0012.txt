of which Augustus should be the centra] figure,
and the emperor himself is said to have written
to him from Spain (Bc. 27) encouraging him to

heralds as ‘something greater than 1116 Iliad'.2
While he was engaged on its composition in Β.Ο.

Augustus, died, and Virgil introduced into the
sixth Book the famous passage (861-888) in which
he 15 described, and of which the story 15 told that
when the poet recited it in the presence of Octavia,
the bereaved mother fainted away.3 In Rc. 20 he
visited Greece and met Augustus, who was returning

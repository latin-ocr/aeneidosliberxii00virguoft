90 VERG. AEN. XII.

719. quis] used loosely for uter, although there are only
two combatants ; cf. 727.

724. fragor] ‘ crash’ of their meeting.

725. Iuppiter ..] So before the final meeting between
Achilles ancl Hector, Il. 22. 209:

καὶ τότε δὴ χρύσεια πατὴρ ἐτίταινε τάλαντα·

ἐν δ’ ἐτίθει δύο κῆρε τανηλεγέος θανάτοιο,

τὴν μὲν Ἀχιλλῆος, τὴν δ”Ἐκτορος ἱπποδάμοιο.

'effice δὲ μέσσα λαβών· ῥέπε δ’ ’Έκτορος αἴσιμον ἦμαρ.

aequato examine] ‘in even poise'3 lit. ‘the tongue of the
balince being made even.' examen from exiyo is ‘ that which
ma es exact.

727. quem damnet ] the subj. is that of oblique question :
‘he puts in the opposing fates of the two (to see) which of
them the struggle dooms, with which weight death siuks?
The sinking scale marks death 3 on the other hand, in Milton,
RL. 4. 996, where

“ Th' Eternal
Hung forth in Heav'n his golden scales, yet seen
Betwixt Astraea and the Scorpion sign. ’²

Satan's scale ‘ kick'd the bea1n‚’ marking that he was ‘ weigh'd
ssncbshown how light, how weak ’ 3 cf. Ps. lxii. 9 ; Daniel

7⁶28. emieat hie ] ‘ then, deeming it secure, Turnus flashes
forth.' The description of Jupiter, 725-727, is introduced
parenthetically, and Virgil now resumes his description of the
combat. Turnus, seeing what seems a safe opportunity,
strikes with lightning speed (cf. emicat).

729. consurg-it in ensem] ‘ rises on to his sword‚’ i.e. so as
to throw his whole weight into the stroke.

730. et ferit] N otice the effect of the rapid dactyl followed
by a strong pause ; cf. 951 ; 5. 643.

732. deserit, ni subeat] An irregular sentence in which
something has to be supplied mentally—‘ the false sword fails
him (and he would be helpless) did not flight come to his aid.’
But, as Sidgwick remarks, the compressed irregular phrase
gives a sense of vividness and rapidity.

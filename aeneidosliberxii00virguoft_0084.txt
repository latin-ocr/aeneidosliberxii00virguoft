56 VERG. AEN. XII.

208. cum semel...] ‘since once (for all) it has left the
parent 'tree and let fall beneath the knife' imo: because
stirps = a tree-trunk, is regularly masc. in Virgil‚ cf. 770, 781,
but fem. when used metaphorically‚ cf. 6. 684, mayna de
stirpe nepotum.

211. dedit gestare] ‘gave it to carry.' This epexegetic inf.
is very common in Virgil after εἷος cf. 5. 247, dat ferre
talentum, ‘ gives to take away ’ ; 260, loricam donat habere ;
and so Hom. Il. 23. 512, δῶκε δ’ ἄγειν ἑτάροισι ὑπερθύμοισι
’γυναῖκα Ι Καὶ τρίποδ’ ὠτώεντα φέρειν.

214. in flammam] i.e. so that the blood poured upon the
altar. et viscera vivis . ι the entrails were offered almost

before the victim had ceased to breathe; cf. G. 2. 194, lanci-
bus et pandis fumantia reddimus effeta.

216-243. The Rutulians see that the combatants are ill-
marchen, and Juturna, sak-inq the form of the warrior Camers,
taunts them with shrinlcingy from α, foe inferior in ‘numbers and
in valour, while, like sluqssardS, they allow Turum* to win name
ancl fame by sacrificinq him-wffsor them. She thus excites their
eaqerness for a qeneral enfsaqement.

216. videri, misceri] historic infinitives.

218. tum magis] opposed to iamdudum. They had ‘long ’
been uncasy, thinking the combat unfair, but ‘then (they
were) still more so, as they see (the combatants) closer their
strength unequaL' The acc. after cernunt is eos ( = ‘ the com-
batants') to be supplied from ea puqowi, and ‘non viribus
aequis is probably a simple ablative of quality, ‘when they
see them of unequal strength‚’ or it might be abl. absolute,
‘their strength being unequal.' The obvious suggestion non
viribus aequos makes the construction more commonplace and
less Virgilian.

219. adiuvat] ‘ aids,' i.e. increases the feeling of uneasiness.
The figure of Turnus here as he steps forward ‘with silent
gait' and ‘down-cast eye‚’ his cheeks ‘worn' and his face
‘wan,’ is in striking contrast with his previous ‘violence‚'
and marks that the sense of impending <loom overpowers him,
while it naturally increases the anxiety of the Rutulians.

221. tabentes] Most mss. have pubentes. iuvenali: ‘youth-
fu1‚’ and so unfit to face a tried warrior like Aeneas.

of a falling crag which works remorseless devastation. The
eagle is specially so-called here because it typifies ‘the
shameless stranger’ (inprobus advena, 261) who is bringing
havoc into Italy.

used when the Trojans found that the prophccy about ‘ eating
their tables' was happily fulfilled by their eating some cakes
which they had used as platters to support their food.

260. accipio] se. omen=the common Gk. phrase ἐδεξάμην

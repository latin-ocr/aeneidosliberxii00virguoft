845. Usually the three Furies, Tisiphone, Alecto, and
Megaera, have their dwelling in Tartarus (6. 280, 571), but
Virgil here clearly distinguishes between the ‘twin plagues
whose name is Dreadful,' who attend at the portals of Jove,
and their sister, who he describes as Tartaream, i.e. inhabit-
ing Tartarus. dicuntur, ‘are told of,' seems to mark the
account given of them as somewhat novel. cognomine: the
coqnomen is a name which ‘corresponds' or ‘answers to'
something. In Roman names it follows the praenomen and

nomen, originally marking some personal quality or distinction, -

e. g. T. Manlius Torquatus, M. Crassus Dives3 and hence is
frequently used, as here, of ‘ a name which fits,' these plagues
being fitly called ‘ the Dread beings' (Σεμναί).

846. Nox intempesta] A phrase also found G. 1. 247, and
in Lucr. and Cicero, and generally rendered ‘unseasonable
night,’ ‘night when no man can work.’ Cf. Varro 7. 72, nox
intempesta, qno tempore nihil affirm· ; Macrob. Sat. l. 3.

847. uno eodemque] eodem is made a dissyllable (by syni-
zesis) and then elided.

848. serpentum spiris] the ‘snaky coils' of their hair.
ventosas, ‘windy'; a suggestive epithet which is best left
unexplained. Conington well quotes Zechariah v. 9, “and
behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their
wings.'’

850. adparent] ‘attend'3 the word suggests the appari-
tores or ‘ public officers ' of magistrates·

851. deum rex] The monosyllabis: ending is intended to
suggest awe ; so too the novel ending of 863.

854. inque omen] ‘as a warning'; lit. ‘so as to be an
omen.5

856. per nubem] ‘through a cloud.' Virgil wishes to
emphasize the idea of the arrow coming from no visible
source (fidroppingss as we might say, ‘from the clouds'), cf.
859, ‘whirring and undetected it cleaves the swift shade.'
He does so in order to suggest how the Fury appears as if
from nowhere.

NOTES. 83

625. hac] emphatic, ‘here‚' ‘in this direction‚' where we
are already victorious, and not turning away to the town
which has ‘ others to defend it.'

627. manu: 6⁴29. manu] This word is often added almost
pleonastically to emphasize vigorous personal action or effort3
cf. 23, 317, 605, and perpetually in the Georgics (often in the
phrase ipse manu) where Virgil lays stress on the importance
of personal effort, eg. G. 1. 179, 199; ⁶2. 126; 3. 32. Cf.
Tennyson‚ The Passing of Arthur, ‘⁴ I will arise and slay thee
with my hand.''

629. et nos] Just as Aeneas is fighting under the walls, so
'let us too (here) hurl death upon the Trojans.⁷

631. Turnus ad. haec] ‘ Thereto Turnus (answered),’ the verb
of ‘saying' or ‘ replying' being, as often, omitted. Incom-
plete lines, like these, are fairly common in the Aeneid, which
was left unfinished by Virgil at his death.

632. esdudum ] ‘ both long since I recognized thee, when
first with cunning thou , and now vainly dost thou (seek to)
hide thy deity)

634. fallis dea: λανθάνεις θεὰ οὖσα.

636. an fratris...] ‘or was it that thou mightest behold
thy brother’s cruel death ?‘ The force of an is pathetic. It
is often used in rhetorical argument to introduce a question an
affirmative answer to which is almost impossible (eg. ‘ This
must be true. Or will you argue that ‘2²3 cf. Cic. Cat.
l. 1. 3), but here the point is that the answer which might
have been supposed impossible is the true one. She must
have been sent to witness her brother-'s death.

637. nam quid ago] ‘ for what am I to do ‘3’ In short ques-
tions the indicative is sometimes put for the deliberative subj.
to give greater force and vividness ; cf. 3. 38, quem sequimur3
367, quae prima pericula vito :⁹ 10. 675, accipio :⁹ quid ayo ?

638. ante ipse meos] = ‘ before my very eyes ' ; the position
of ipse is due to its natural attraction to personal pronouns
and their adjectives 3 cf. 660. voce vocantem ε cf. 483 n.

640. ingentem...] ‘mighty warrior and conquered by a
mighty wound’ ; the phrase is copied from Hom. Il. 16. 776,
κεῖτο μέγας μεγαλωστί.

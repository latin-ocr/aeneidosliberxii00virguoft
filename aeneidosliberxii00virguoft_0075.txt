NOTES. 47

consonante the second of which is Z or r. rubrae cornua
cristae: the horns are projections on the top of the helmet
into which the crests were fitted. See Bayfield, Homer's
Iliad, Appendix A, on the words φάλος (zcornu), ἀμφίφαλος,
τρυφάλεια = τετρυ-φάλεια, ‘ four-horned helmet.’

91. et Stygia...] Steel was regularly tempered by being
‘dipped in water (ef. 8. 450; G. 4. 172), and some waters (eg.
that of the Bilbilis or Salo in Spain, Mart. l. 49. 12) were

97. da sternere] ‘grant (me) to lay low.'
98. revulsam] ‘torn back ' or ‘ open,' i. e. by the spear.

99. semiviri Phrygis] ‘the emasculate' or ‘unmanned
Phrygian.' The term ‘Phrygian’ is often used by Virgil
contemptuously (cf. 753 4. 103) with a suggestion of Oriental
cowardice and effeminacy, and in semiviri there is also a
reference to the eunuch priests of the Phrygian goddess
Cybele.

In 4. ‘205 seq. the jealous Iarbas also jeers at Aeneas as ‘a
perfumed Paris with his eunuch train‚' and Virgil's concep-
tion of Aeneas is clearly not that of a rude and rugged
warrior, but rather of a handsome cavalier whose looks did
not belie his divine mother.

irons.’

describes it as ‘ rather exaggerated‚' but Sidgwick says that
‘it may be paralleled in many languages,’ neglectiug, how-
ever, to support this assertion.

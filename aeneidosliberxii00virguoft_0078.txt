50 VERG. AEN. XII.

129. utque...] ‘and when at the given signal each has
withdrawn to his own portion of the lists‚’ i.e. when, iu
order to clear the lists, the spectators have withdrawn to
the places severally assigned them.

131. studio effusae] ‘ in eager streams.’

133. portis ] ‘ take their stand upon the towering gates.'
Clearly not ‘stand beside the gates,’ for they would get no
view, and sublimibus would have no force. The ‘roof over
the gate’ is in ancient cities a regular post for watchmen;
cf. l Sam. xviii. 24.

134-160. ‚Iuno summons the nymph J lamna, the sister of
Turum, and prays her, as ⁸}ae herself can do no more, to save
her brother by hinderiny the proposed combac.

134. e summo] with tmnulo 136, ‘from the hill's top that
now is styled Alban (then the mountain had neither name ...)
as she gazed beheld .’ According to Virgil’s story Alba
Lonsya was founded on this mountain by Ascanius, after which
it became ‘ the Alban Mount,’ famous for the temple of Jupiter
Latiaris on its summit, and the Latin games (feriae Latinae)
which were celebrated there.

Juno takes her seat on the Alban Mount just as in Homer
the deities do so on Mount Ida when they wish to watch

events at Troy.

139. diva deam] ‘goddess (addressing) goddess’; their
common deity is a bond of sympathy to which Juno appeals
(cf. Hom. Od. 5. 95, εἰρωτᾷς μ’ ἐλθόντα θεὰ θεόν). The asson-
anoe, too, of the phrase is clearly tempting to a poet. Many

Iuturna was an Italian nymph or deity especially connected
with streams of a healing character (Iuturna a iuvando), and
Lutatius Catulus built a chapel to her in the Campus Martius,
see Ov. Fast. 1. 463 and Class. Dict. Virgil here identifies

her with the deified sister of Turnus.

140. hunc ...] ‘this honour (i.e. of presiding over rivers,
eto.) Jove, the high lord of heaven, dedicated to her in return
for her ravished maidenhood.'

142. animo ..] Cf. Hom. Il. 5. 243, ἐμῷ κεχαρισμένε θυμῷ.

88 VERG. AEN. XII.

69l. stridunt] ‘whistle'; Virgil prefers the form stridere
to the common stridere.

694. quaecunque ...] ‘whate'er the issue it is mine.’
Fortuna: fortuna pussnae3 whatever the issue, victory or
defeat, he claims that he should take the risk by himself.
verius: ‘fairer ’ς cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 7. 98, metiri se quemque suo
modulo ac pede verum esc.

695. foedus luere] ‘ expiate‚’ or ‘ atone for the treaty‚’ i.e.
for its breaking, foedus being :foedus ruptum. Conington
gives luere = ‘pay,' and explains poenas pro rupto foedere luere,
but, although in a condensed phrase, the mind may readily
supply one unexpressed idea (in this case ruptum), yet it
cannot supply two.

*696 discessere medii] they were ‘in the middle? and ‘ went
apart ’ from it ; we must render, however, ‘ retired from the

middle. '

697-745. Aenea* laevem to the eombat, huffe as α mountain, ’
and all eyes are centred on the two champions. They meet
with α crash, like that of two bulls contendina for lordship,
while in heaven Jupiter decide-3 their (loom in the scales of
destiny. The ,ςιυονιί of Turnus, which was not his own, is
shivered on tlte «livine armo‘zcr estiment-5, and lte tw‘ns in fligyhc.

The striking comparison (701-3), the simile (715-722), and
the reference to the solemn arbitrament of Jupiter <725-727)
all mark the supreme importance of this final struggle.

698. deserit et et deserit] repetition expressing eager-
ness. ‘ Abanslons the walls ⁷ :abandons the attack on them.

699. ‘ and flings over all delay, breaks off every task ⁷ ; the
asyndeton (ἀσύνδετον, absence of connecting particle) again
emphasizes his eagerness.

700. horrendumque...] ‘and thunders dreadfully on his
arms' ; cf. 332n.‚ and for horrendum, 398 n.

701. ‘huge as Athos, huge as Eryx, aye or, what time he
roars with his tossing oaks, huge as father Apennine himself,
proudly rising heavenward with snowy crest.’ The triple
repetition of quantus gives emphasis, which is made still
inore forcible by the striking position of the word in 702.
The idea is borrowed from Il. 13. 754, ἧ ῥα καὶ ὡρμήθη ὄρεϊ

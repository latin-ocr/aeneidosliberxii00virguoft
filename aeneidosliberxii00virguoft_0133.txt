 

N OTES. 105

932. sorte] the ‘ chance ' or ‘fortune of war' which has
fallen to you (tua), and which you have the right to use to the
full by slaying me.

933. fuit et tibi talis ] ‘ and thou too didst once have a
father, Anchises, in like case‚' i.e. old and anxious for his son.
So Il. 22. 420, Priam thinks that Achilles may pity his age
when he thinks of his own father-wal δέ νυ τῷ ’γε πατὴρ τοιόςδε
τέτυκται, Ι Πηλεύς.

935. ‘and give back me, or, if thou wilt, my lifeless body
to my kin.’ Turnus pleads for his life, or at least that hc
may be buried by his kinsfolk, and not be flung to the dogs
(cf. Il. 22. 339, μή με ἔα παρὰ νηυσὶ κύνας καταδάψαι Ἀχαιῶν

- σῶμα δὲ οἰκάδ’ ἐμὸν δόμεναι πάλιν). Sidgwick says, ‘for his

own life he does not care,’ and Conington speaks of ‘his
indifference to death‚' but the whole passage shows that his
prayer is really for his life, aud that Virgil represents Aeneas
as on the point of granting it (940).

936. victum] sc. me. He is not only defeated, but has
acknowledged his defeat before all the host.

941. infelix...] The ‘ill—starred baldric,’ which catches
the eye of Aeneas, is the one which Turnus had taken from
Pallas after slaying him3 cf. 10. 495, where it is described as
of ‘vast weight,’ with the story of the Danaids chased on its
heavy gold plates. The second clause et...bullis merely
amplifies the first; ‘when the ill-started baldric met his
view, and the sword-belt flashed with its well-known studs.’

943. pueri] ‘young’; added to increase the pathos.

944. inimicum insigne] probably merely the badge or
tropby ‘won from his foe‚' though inimicum may possibly
also suggest that the trophy was fatal to its wearer.

945. oculis...hausit] ‘when he devoured (lit. ‘drank in ³)
with his eyes the trophy that recalled cruel grief.' exuviasque
is added to explain monimenta. For hausit, cf. 4. 661,
hauriat hunc oculis igynem3 4. 359, vocemque his auribus hausi.

947. ‘Art thou, thou bedecked in the spoils of those I
loved‚ to be snatched hence from me?’ indute is more
vigorous than the nom. would be; cf. 2. 283, quibus, Hector,
aberis Ι exspectate venis ? Conington explains hinc ‘ after this,
i.e. after ‹laring to wear this trophy, but quotes no parallel
for such a use.

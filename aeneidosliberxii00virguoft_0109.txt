NOTES. 81

589. trepidae rerum] ‘terrified about their fortunes’; tre-
pidus expresses fright which is exhibited in restless nervous
movement. The gen. is objective and very common, especi-
ally in late Latin, after adjectives expressing ‘ care’ or ‘ care·
lessness,’ e. g. anxius, certus, parma«, imaum-5³3 see Kenncdy
Publ. Sch. Gr. ξ 136. 2. ; Roby S. G. 5⁶25. b.

591. ater odor: murmure caeco] A curious instance of the
way in which adjectives which refer to one particular sense
can be applied to another. The steneli is called ater, etc.,
because it is ‘deadly’; the murmur caecum, because it is
‘ undistinguishable‚⁷ i.e. confused.

593—613. Amata, seems] the attach and thinkinsl Turnus dead,
hams-5 herself. Lavinia aml chtinus berc-<til her.

595. tectis] ‘from the pala-ce-roof.'

597. nusquam ] ‘ that nowhere is there a Rutulian array
confronting them!

599. mentem turbata] Cf. 172 n.

600. Note the vehement alliteration in causam, clamat,
crimen, caput. crimen: ‘ guilt' is here used rhetorically=
⁴ the person guilty ’ς cf. thc common Gk. use of μῖσος, στύγος
z‘a person hated,' βλαβή, ‘a person injurious‚' etc.‚ and
Prop. 1. ll. 3, a pereant Baiae crimen amoris aquae ; 4. 19.
15, crimen ec illa fnit. Its position between causam and
caput (= ‘source’) makes its meaning here absolutely clear.

602. moritura] ‘ resolved to die.'

603. informis] ‘ hideous.' According to Servius the ‘ ponti-
fical books’ ordained that the corpse of anyone who com-
mitted suicide by hanging should be ‘ flung out unburied‚' and,
although in Greek tragedy Iocasta (Soph. O.R. 106) and
Phaedra (Eur. Hipp. 802) hung themselves, the Romans seem
to have regarded this method of sels-destruction as especially
‘hideous' and repulsive. In the century after Virgil the
Stoic ‘ exit ⁵ (ἐξαγωγή) was usually accomplished by abstinence
from food or the opening of a vein.

605. flores] So Servius for the flavos of Mss, quoting the
phrase flori crines from Accius and Pacuvius, and explaining
the word as :florzclentuZ08‚ pulchros, so that it describes the
brightness, bloom, and glossiness of her hair. Virgil was fond
of archaic phrases, and a rare word likefloros· would easily be
corrupted by copyists into a simple one like flavos.

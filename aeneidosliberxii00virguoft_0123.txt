NOTES. 95

surely, however ‘ refreshed in spirit,’ both warriors must have
been a little out of breath still, and the description of them as
facing each other ⁶ panting' is highly natural, whereas M ars
anhelus is a most startling phrase. Conington with weak
authority reads certamine. ·

792. de nube] Apparently Juno has taken up her position
in a cloud so as to watch the combat unseen and be ready to
interfere. In 796 Jupiter asks her ‘ with what hope she still
lingers amid the chilly clouds,' and 842, when she complies
with his request to give up all thought of intervention, she
‘quits the sky and abandons the eloud.' Virgil therefore
seems to regard the clouds here as intermediate between earth
and the dwelling of the gods, so that they can resort to them
whenever they wish to watch human affairs more closely.
fulva: ‘golden'3 cf. 7. 279, fulvum aurum.

793. finis] i.e. of your persecution of Aeneas; see Intr.
p. xv.

794. indigetem] The word describes one who, after doing
great services to his country, is deified as one of its special
heroes and protectors. Cf. G, l. 498, di patrii, indigyete-S, et
Romule Vestaque BIater, ‘ ye gods and heroes of our country,
even thou, O Romulus, and thou, O Vesta,' where Vesta is
appealed to as holding a high place among the cli patr-ii and
Romulus among the indiqetes, the two classes corresponding
to the Greek θεοὶ καὶ ἡρῶες οἱ ἐγχώριοι. Livy 1. 2. 6 refers to a
so-called tomb of Aeneas where he was honoured under the
title of Iovem indigyetem.

795. deberi caelo] i.e. that heaven and immortality claim
him, so that to devise his destruction (cf. quid struis) is
absurd. The opposite phrase is found 111 Hor. A.P. 63, debemur
morti nos nostraque.

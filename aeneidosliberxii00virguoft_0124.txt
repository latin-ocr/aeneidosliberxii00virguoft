96 VERG. AEN. XII.

795. fatisque] ‘ by destiny‚' which throughout the Aeneid is
the ruling power. On the whole it is identical with the ‘ will ’
(cf. 808) of Jupiter, the supreme deity, but even he seems
bound to act according to its laws, so that J uno only asks him
to grant something ‘which is not fixed by any law of destiny'
(819). The gods have all, according to their degrees, a certain
power of ruling events, and the ‘ will ’ of Jupiter in turn
governs the gods, but ‘ destiny ' or ‘ fate’ seems a still higher
power, the decisions of which he cannot control, but only
declare or determine (eg. 726, by ‘ weighing destinies ²).

796. gelidis] ‘chilly'; a very odd epithet, which seems to
ffififfff that J uno would be more comfortable by the domestic

74397. mortalin] For scansion cf. 503n.; and for meaning
n.

798. quid enim ] The clause explains why he reproaches
Juno with restoring the sword; he does so because without
J uno’s support J uturna could have done nothing.

801. nec te ...] ‘that such grievous pain may not consume
thee in silence and (that) bitter troubles (may not) so often
come to me from thy sweet lips.' For -Juno's pain, see
1. 11, 12; 25, where its cause is given as iudicium Paridis
spretaeque iniuria formae. Notice that the negative force of.
ne extends to the second clause, also the humour with which
Virgil makes Jupiter appeal to feminine love of a com-
pliment. dulci tristes: antithetic juxtaposition.

803. ad supremum] ‘ to the final issue '3 cf. 424 n.

805. ‘ to disfigure a home and confound the bridal-song with
lamentation.’ deformare describes the change in the outward
appearance of the house caused by the death of Amata, the
trappings of woe being substituted for the gay decoratione
which the marriage of Turnus would have required.

808. ista quidem] The emphasis on the pronoun is clear,
and suggests that in spite of Juno's ‘downcast visage' she
speaks with a little personal feeling. In translating we must
alter the form of the sentence—‘ That indeed, I know well, is
thy good pleasure, ancl therefore have Ι, unwillingly, aban·
doned both ‚⁷

NOTES. 67

364. sternacis] ‘ restive.' The word, which occurs here for
the first time, is formed like suqaoe z szz'sugyit, edax = qui edit,
beingzqui sternit (equitem), It is curious that we have no
English equivalent for such an expressive and useful adjec-
tive.

365-370. Notice the order in this simile. We have (1) the
‘pursuing blast and (2) the flying winds, but then, in inverted
order (2) the fiying hosts and (1) the pursuing Turnus. The
simile is Homerie, cf. Il. 4. 4193 11. 305; 15. 624.

366. insonat Aegaeo] ‘falls with a roar 011 the Aegaeas
sequiturque ε It is impossible to say whether fluctus is aec.
plur. (‘the storm chases the billows’) or nom. sing. (‘and
then the billow rushes shorewards ⁷).

369. fert ] ‘ his rusb sweeps him (see 301 n.) along, while
the breeze, as his ohariot meets it, tosses his flying plume.'
The picture of the plumes tossing in the wind caused by the
rush of the chariot is intended to bring out the idea of great
speed.

3712 non tulit ] ‘ Phegeus could not brook his onset and
angry rage; (therefore) upon the chariot he flung himself and
wrenohed aside .⁷ Cf< 10. 578, haud tulit Aeneas tanto fer-
vore furentes, Ι inruit, where, as here, haud tulit marks that
Aeneas finds the ferocity of the foe ² unbearable' and so is
spurred on to attack- him 3 but here non tulit instantem is harsh,
because it naturally suggests the meaning, ‘ did not end ure his
onset,‘ i.e. fied from 11. In both passages the asyndeton
between non tulit and the following verb suggests rapidity.

374. dum trahitur...] ‘as he is dragged hanging to the
yoke, the broad lance-head (i1e. of Turnus) pierees him
exposed‚’ i.e. while unable to use his shield 3 ef. 377.

376. summum ] ‘ and with its wound just grazes the sur-
face of his body ι’ for the metaphor 111 ‹leym-stat, ‘tastes‚' cf.

ll. 804, hasta alte bibit acta cruorem, where we can render
literally ‘ drinks blood.'

377. tamen] i.e. in spite of his wound and dangerous posi-
tion ‘ he still, covering himself with his sffield, turned and was
making for his foe when the wheel dashed him headlong .’

379. praecipitem procursu] alliteration to give the sense of
rapid rush. The same idea is brought out by the repetition in
rota and concitus axi-s (⁶ wheel and whirling axle ²).

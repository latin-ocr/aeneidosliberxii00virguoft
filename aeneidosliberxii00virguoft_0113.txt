N OTES. 85

istius culpae] ‘of that' or ‘such reproach.' iste, from its
constant use in argument to refer to opponents or their acts
and words, acquires a conteniptuous or indignant sense, and
is here highly emphatic = ‘ that reproach which is flung in my
teeth) Moreover Turnus is thinking of Drances and his
detractors, and, though addressing the Manes, it is their re-
proaches that he is really answering3 ‘your taunt‚' he says, ‘is
false.’ Conington refers istius to vos, and explains ‘ the fault
which you hate, cowardice‚’ but there is 110 word anywhere
of the Manes finding any ‘ fault’ with Turnus.

649. magnorum... avorum] A rather favourite assonance.
indigynccs only occurs (Sil. It. 8. 385, indiynus acorum, is a
copy) here with the genitive.

650-696. Saces brinys news of the city’s pliqht (md the need
sor help from Turnus, who is atfir-st dmed, but then, reeoreriny
himself, declares his resolve to meet Aenea-s. Leapz'nss from his

lodgyed from a mountain eray, and eries alourl that Ite eomes to

6513 adversa...] ‘wounded right in the face with an

653. s7iiprema salus] ‘ our last hope of safety!

654. minatur deiecturum] sc. se, ‘threatens that he will
lay low the topmost towers ’; for the omission of the pronoun
cf. 762, excisurum urbem minima& and Conington quotes
Livy 6. 17, refracturosque carcerem minabantur.

657. oculos referunt] ‘turn their eyes.' re here does not
mean ‘back,' but merely indicates that the direction of the
gaze is changed, and that it is fixed on a special point; so, too,
671, respexit ad urbem, ‘turned his regard upon thc town,'
and commonly in conversation, respice ad me, ad evm, ad
laevam, etc. mussat: a graphio word used (l) of men (ll.
454, flent moesti onus-samque patres) or even animals (cf. 718)
making a low, scarcely audible, muttering 01· murmur when
in anxiety or doubt, and then (2)=‘doubt‚’ ‘hesitate‚' as
here, Latinus muttering to himself, ‘in doubt what sons-in-
aw to invite.'

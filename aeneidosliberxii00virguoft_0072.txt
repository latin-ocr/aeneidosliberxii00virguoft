Turnus dies.

64. lacrimis] with accepit: she ‘heard her mother’s utter-
ance with tears.’ But the word is also mentally supplied
with flet-(fraules perfusa qenes (for construction see 172)=
‘ bathing her burning cheeks (with tears).’

65. cui ] ‘ while (lit. ‘to whom ²) a deep blush kindled a
fiame, and mantled o'er her glowing face.’ The blush is
said to kindle a fire (innam subicere) in her face, though strictly
it is the inward fire which should create the blush.

cf. Sil. It. 3. 133, where Hannibal, as he sets forth against
Rome, says to his wife, ominibus parce et lacrimis. To see
soldiers off with cheering and good wishes (cf. 9. 310, prose-
quitur votis) is common everywhere, but the Romans attached

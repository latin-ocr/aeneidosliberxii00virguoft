NOTEs. 41

32. ex illo] ‘from that ' = ‘in consequence ² ; but the mean
ing ‘from that time ' is not exclucled.

33. primus] ‘above all.'

34. vix urbe ] ‘ scarcely with our walls can we guard the
hopes (or ‘fortunes’) of Italy.' They were defeated in the
field and not secure even within their walls.

35. recalent] The prefix re· perhaps marks an alteration in
the condition described by the verb: the stream is now hot
instead ofcold ; cf. replere = make full instead of empty.

37. quo referor...] ‘ why (lit. ‘ to what end ? ’) am I so often
beaten back ‘2 What madness changes my purpose? ' Latinus
asks why he so often ⁴ goes baek' (as we say) from the resolu-
tion which he is bound ultimately to carry out of accepting
Aeneas as his son. For quo: ‘ to what purpose?' see Wilkins
on Hor. Ep. 1. 5. 12.

Conington gives : ‘⁴ ‘ Whither am I being carried backwards
and forwards ‘2’ implying that he is distracted among the
multitude of thoughts and plans‚'' but there is no question of
Latinus being distracted between a number of plans. He
sees his proper course clearly, but allows consideratione such
as those mentioned in lines 29, 30 to hold him back.

38. Turno exstineto] ‘when Turnus is dead.')(incolumi:
‘while he is still uninjured.’ socios adscire: ‘to welcome
them (the Trojans) as allies'

41. fors dicta refutet] Reing compelled to use the ill-
omeued words, ‘if Ι shall have betrayed thee to death‚’
Latinus before he completes the phrase interposes this prayer
in order to avert the omen.

42. conubia nostra] ‘a union with our house.'

43. respice ] ‘ have regard to the changeful issues of war.’
bello is perhaps abl. ε ‘in war‚’ or more probably dative either
‘of the possessor⁷ (‘the changes which belong to war') or
‘ethic' (‘which affect war')‚ and so hardly distinguishable
from the genitive, cf. 10. 160, eremus belli varios. It must be
remembered that strict grammatical analysis of such phrases
is really impossible, their peculiarity of shape being due to
the poet's desire of avoiding what is commonplace, and there
being no wish on his part to exclude any of the slight varia-

gitglns of meaning which may attach to an ambiguous form like
e o.

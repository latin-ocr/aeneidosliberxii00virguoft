NOTES. 97

811. digna. indigna pati] A very compressed phrase, which
means ‘to endure all things without regard to the question
whether they were fit or unfit to be endured,' ‘ to endure all
things, meet or unmeet.⁷ In English some connecting particle
is inserted between the two contrasted ad jectives (e.g. ‘wrong
or right‚’ ‘ fan and lean,' ‘good and bad ²), but Latin, accord-
ing to its regular idiom, usually puts them simply side by
side, e.g. bona mala, honesta turpia, tacenda dicenda, though
it sometimes inserts ‘and‚’ cf. 9. 595, disma atque indiyna
relatulvocfferarzs, as in Greek, ῥητὰ καὶ ἄῤῥητα ὀνομάζων, ῥητὸν
ἄῤῥητόν τ’ ἔπος. flammis cineta: ‘engirdled with fire,' i.e.
decked in all the terrors of wrathful deity, of which fire is the
visible symbol, see the Ο.Τ. passim. sub here merely describes
close proximity ; ‘ close on the very line of battle)

814. et pro vita... ] ‘and for his life Ι assented that she
should dare too bold a deed, yet not (so far as) that she should

καὶ τὸ κατειβόμενον Στινγός ὕδωρ, ὅς τε μέγιστος
ὅρκος δεινότατός τε πέλει μακάρεσσι θεοῖσι.

caput is used with a double meaning (1): ‘ fountain-head,'

to ‘ swear by the head,' ‘invoke curses on the head: etc.

to the request contained in 821 seq—s This I enm-eat thee
nob to command (ne iubeas).’

of thy kin) Saturn had reigned in Latium, and was the

42 VERG. AEN. XII.

46. exsuperat...] ⁵ it rises higher (cf. line 20, and 2. 759,
exsuperant flammae) and grows angrier from the remedy.’

medendo is abl. of the gerund, used as a verbal noun z ‘ by the
healing,' ‘ by the attempt to heal,¹ a use which is very common
in Yirgil, eg. ha‘bendo, ‘ ior handling,' 88 Ξ cantando, ‘ by

a thing)‚' ante domandum, ‘before breaking in (a eolt),' eto.

aegrescit medendo] A fine instance osterse antithesis. The
soft speech of Latinus acts like some remedy which only
ἓξξὲἓζᾶἡεε a disease, makes a wound angrier, or a sever

47. institit] much more vigorous than the weakly sup-
ported incipit. The word suggests vigour and movement (cf.
insistere viam), and is also used 4. 533, sic adeo insi-stit of
Dido‘s ‘ outbreak ' into reproaches after a sleepless night.

48. pro me...p1·o me] emphatic repetition, still further
strengthened by the position of the second pro me. The tone
is angry3 the speaker objects to being treated like a child
who cannot help himself 01· take care of himself. So, too,
optime is the politeness of passion ; cf. too sinas, ‘ permit.'

49. letumque...] ‘to barter death for fame‚’ cf. 5. 230,
vitamque volunt pro Zancle pacisci, in exactly the same sense.
KVhen you wish to purchase fame, you may be said to offer
your ‘life ² or ‘ death ' as the price.

50. et nos] ‘ we too,' i.e. as well as Aeneas. haud. debile:
litotes, see 25 11. tela ferrumque, by hendiadys (cf. 869 11.),
= iron-headed darts 3 ferrum can hardly be z ‘ sword,’ as
opposed to ‘darts’ or ‘ spears,' because of sparyimus.

52. longe ...] ‘Far away shall he find his goddess mother
to hide in cloud his womanly flight, while she conceals her-
self,' etc. In Homer the deities eontinually veil their own
presence, and rescue their favourite heroes from danger by
this device of concealment in a cloud; cf. Il. 20. 443, where
Apollo so saves Aeneas from Achilles. The expression feminea
nube is hard to translate; ‘unmanly’ and ‘womanly cloud'
are absurd in English. The adj. marks escaping by conceal-
menssdin a cloud as a device which (though Homeric) no man
wou resort to.

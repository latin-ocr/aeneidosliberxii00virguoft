NOTES. 89

νιφόεντι ἐοικώς (of Hector), but elaborated in Virgil's manner 3
cf. too Milton P. L. 4. 985 :

“On th' other side Satan, alarm'd,
Collecting all his might, dilated stood,
Like Teneriffe or Atlas unremoved.⁷'

Athos ε”Αθως has the last syllable long; but G. 1. 332, aut
ΑεΙιόη aut Rhodopen.

703. pater Appenninus] To assist his comparison‚ Virgil
personifies the mountain, as he does Mt. Atlas, 4. 247-251 ;
cf. such persona] names as szqfrau and M ench. pater marks
veneration and affection; cf. pater Tiberinus, G. 4. 369.

706. ariete] ‘ battering ram.' The word forms a dactyl, z·
(zy) being treated as a consonant3 so, elsewhere, pariete,
abiet& cf. 747, 821. (

707. armaque ...] Cf. 130. Benoist oddly explains “arma,

leurs bouchem, qu'ils placent sur leurs epauless' stupet
coiisse, ‘is amazed that (they) have met.'

709. cernere ferro] exactly=decernere ferro, 695, ‘decide
(the issue) with the sword‚’ but cernere in this sense seems
archaic (found in Ennius and Lucu).

713. invadunt Martem] ‘attack the fray.' clipeis atque
aere sonoro: hendiadys5 the brazen shields sound as they
are dashed together.

713. dat gemitum tellus] the earth seems to re-echo the
clang of battle with a groan.

714. fors ..] ‘chance and valour are confounded in one.'
The phrase seems to mark the fury of the eombatants, who,
disdaining caution, dash together in a. melec in which it looks
as if chance alone could decide the issue. Any one, who has
seen two boxers drop scientific sparring and really set to, will
understand the idea which Virgil wishes to suggest.

715. ac velut ] largely borrowed from G. 3. 220-223.

717. pavidi ] ‘ fied are the terror-strichen herdsmeu.'
cessere is the perfect of rapid action.

718. mussantque...] ‘and the heifers dumbly wait to see
who is to be lord of the fores& For mil-5¹80, cf. 657 n.
Observe the imitative repetition of the m-sound in metu,
mecum, huessant.

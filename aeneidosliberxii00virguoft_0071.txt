N OTES. 43

quae tegat follows longye erit, as if Virgil had written 71072
aderit, to which it is exactly equivalent. The clause et...
umbris is made parallel with the clause quae ...ἱεραί (para-
taxis), though really it should be subordinate. Many editors
try to make sese refer to Aeneas, saying that the whole
relative clause gives the contents of a prayer which he offers
, to Venus—she shall not be present when he prays that she
will conceal his flight and hide him.

54-80. Amata prays Turnus not to hazarcl his list, οη which
all their hope rests, but the beauly aad blushes ofLaz-z'nia only
instame his* passion more, and he bid->- his squire Idmon carry
his challenye to Aeneas.

54. nova. sorte] This ‘new fortune of the combat' is the
unexpected turn it had taken by beeoming a single combat
between the two chiefs.

55. moritura tenebat] ‘strove to stay him with the grasp
of death' In 62 Amata announces her resolve to die, and
600-603 does actually kill herself; but to render moritura
‘ resolved to die' or ‘ destined soon to die' is to anticipate the
narrative too much. The word, no doubt, squests that her
death is imminent, but actually only expresses her deadly
terror, her death-like aspect, as she seeks to detain him.

56. per has ego te lacrimas] The acc. te is governed by oro,
60, the acc. in adjurations being always thrown strongly for-
ward and often violently misplaced (eg. per te deo-3... oro,
πρὸς σὲ θεῶν ἱκνοῦμαι) to give it emphasis. The second per
has for its acc. the whole clause, 81ᾳιι15...3.111ῑηιιω, ‘hy
whatever regard for A. ‘couches thy soul’3 cf. 6. 459, per
superos et si qua fides tell-ure sub ima est 3 2. 1423 Soph, Phil.
469, πρὸς δ’ εἴ τί σοι κατ’ οἶκόν ἐστι προσφιλές.

57-59. speS...1·ecumbit] A parenthetic statement of the
grounds of her appeal. in te : ‘on thee all our sinking house
{glsltlsl'g he is the sole prop or pillar that can save it from

60. desiste commit-tere] For construction cf. 586 n.

61. isto certamine] ‘in that thy combat.' iste here, as
often, marks abhorrence—that combat which you desire but
I detest. So we in English use ‘your'; eg. ‘none of your
French oishes for me.¹

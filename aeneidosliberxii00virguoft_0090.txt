62 VERG. AEN. XII.

repetition of the pronoun in addition to the conjunction
marks great violence; cf. ll. 696, tum validam perque arma
viro perque ossa securim conyeminat.

294. telo trabali] Cf. l Sam. 17. 7, of Goliath, ‘and the
staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam.'

296. 1100 nabet] This, or habet, is the regular phrase used
when a gladiator receives a fatal blow. haec : ‘this is a
nobler victim offered to the mighty gods‚’ 1.0. nobler than
they would have received if the intended sacrifice had been

completed.

298-305. The account of another struggle between a pair of
warriors. Render: ‘Barring the path Corynaeus snatehes a
half-burnt brand from the altar, and as Ebysus advances
first fills his face with flame ; out blazed his mighty heard . .'
Or we might entirely alter the order and give—‘Next as
Ebysus advanced...Corynaeus meeting him snatches, etc.'
occupare is common in the sense of attacking first, i. e. before
the opponent can do anything; cf. 10. 699, saxo occupat os,
and elsewhere ense, yladio, morsu occupare aliquem.

301. super ipse ] ‘ then himself following up the attack
he grasps the (lazed foeman's hair, and pins his whole body
to the ground.' The use of ipse here is noticeable : in 301 it
contrasts the personal onslaught of Corynaeus with the torch
which he had flung, and in 303 ipsum contrasts the whole
figure of Aulestes with the caesaries by which he was at first
gripped. So 369 ipsum contrasts Turnus with his plume.

304. sic] ‘ so‚' 1.0. as he holds him pinned to the ground.

306. 1110] 1.0. Alsus, who turns 011 his pursuer‚ and ‘ draw-
ing back his axe (to strike) cleaves his enemy's forehead in
twain to the chin.' In 309 olli again indicates a change in
the person referred to, being=Podalirius3 cf. carefully its
similar use in 291 and 300. In passages where the person
spoken of is continually varying the change must be made
perfectly clear by guiding pronouns.

309. dura quies, ferreus somnus] Good instances of oxy-
moron, the one requirement of ‘ repose' being that it should
be easy, and of ‘sleep’ that it should be soft (cf. its regular
epithets mollis, μαλακός). For ferreus sommas cf. Hom. II. 11.
741, κοιμήσατο χάλκεον ὕπνον.

Roman Virgss, thou that singesfi

Ilion’s lofby temples robed in fire,
Ilion falling, Rome arising,

wars, and filial saith, and Dido’s pyre3

Π.

Landscape-lover, lord of language

more than he that sang the WVorks and Days,
All the chosen coin of fancy

flashing ouh from many a. golden phraseg

ΙΙΙ.

Thou that singesh wheat and woodland, -
tilssh and vineyard, hive and horse and herd3

All the charm of all the Muses
often flowering iu a loner word ;

1v.

Poet of the happy Tityrus
piping underneath his beechen bowers3
Poet of the poet-satyr
whom the lau ghin g shepherd bound with flowers ς

V.

Chanter of the Pollio, glorying
in the blissful years again to be,
Summers of the snakeless meadow,
unlaborious earth and oarless sea ;

98 VERG. AEN. XII. ᾗ

821. conubiis] The u in ‘'zz‘cbo is long, but in pronv‘iba,
innffbzcs, short. Virgil always has com-{bia (cf. 42), and hence
many would scan conubiis as trisyllabic‚ the firsti being made
consonantal (cf. 706 n. ), but while in conubia the u is regularly
in arsis, in conubii-3 it is regularly in thesis, and Virgil may
therefore regard its quantity as doubtful and dependent upon
its position in the verse. See Munro, Luer. 3. 776.

822. esto] ‘ bitterly consenting to felicibus,’ Conington.

826. sit Latium ..,] ‘let the land be Latium, let the kings be
Alban .' The emphasis is wholly on the proper names ; so
too in the next line on Romana and Itala. According to Virgil
(l. 266 seq.) Ascanius founded Alba Longa and reigned there
for 30 years», and his successors for 300 more, until Romulus
founded Rome.

828. occidit, occideritque sinas] ‘fallen is Troy, and fallen
let it be together with its name.' Although Virgil connects
Rome with Troy, it is clear that the connection is felt to be
wholly literary ancl romantio, while the strong national senti-
ment is entirely opposed to the idea of a foreign and especially
an Asiatic origin. Cf. the remarkably similar language of
JunO, Hor. Od. 3. 3. 18 seq.

829. repertor] ‘designer‚’ or, perhaps, more generally
‘author.’ For this smile of Jove, cf. 1. 254, olli subridens
hominum sator atque deorum 1 vultu, quo caelum tempestatesque
serenat, where it is bestowed on Venus.

830. et germana ] Jupiter here humorously recognizes in
the ‘ waves of passion ' which surge in Juno’s bosom the proof
of her kinship to himself. In Homer and elsewhere he com-
plains of her temper, eg. Il. 5. 892, μένος ἐστὶν ἀνάσχετον
οὐκ ἐπιεικτόν ΙἽ-Ιρης.

Ψΐὸἃῖἰ. ,et inceptum] ‘control the causeless outbreak of thy

833. An admirable line. do, quod vis, by its extreme
simplicity and terseness, marks the supreme authority of the
speaker (cf. the phrase in which the royal assent used to
be given to acts of Parliamemt, Ie Boi Ze veult), while the next
words are uttered in a tone of extreme courtesy—‘ with cheer-
ful submission Ι bow to thy will.' me remitto: ‘ I unbend ' ;
I do not strain my authority.

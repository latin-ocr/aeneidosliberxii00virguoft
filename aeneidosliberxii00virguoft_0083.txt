NOTES. 55

is a great favourite with Latin writers in antithetical sen-
tences, and is so called because in such an instance as ratio
consentit, repuqnat oratio (Cic. de Fin. 3. 3.)‚ if the two first
words are written over the second two and the contrasted
words joined, the lines joining them form X, the Greek chi.
The word socer is especially emphatic ; it is as his father-in-
law that Aeneas yields to Latinus—‘As my sire let Latinus
retain command in battle, as my sire (let him retain) his
wonted sway (ie. his royal authority).'

197. haec eadem iuro] ‘ By these same powers .. Ι swear.'
Like ὄμνυμι, iuro often takes au acc. of the deity in whose
name the oath is sworn. The acc. is really cognate because
the name of the deity forms the oath.

198. Latonaeque genus duplex] the ‘twin children' are
Apollo and Diana, whom Latona bore to Jove in Delos.

200. Genitor] ‘the great Sire‚' i.e. Jupiter, the father of
men and gods, who is invoked last not only as the greatest of
the deities, but as Ζεὺς “Ὀρκιος, the god who especially ‘ sancti-
fies covenants’ by blasting perjurers with his thunderbolt.

201. medios ignes] ‘this intervening fire.' medios is used
in two senses, the first literal, for Aeneas and Latinus stand
with the altar between them, and the second metaphorical,
for the ‘ fire and the gods ' are to be the ‘mediatore' of their
covenant. A ‘mediator’ is one who stands between two
parties, and so Moses, the mediator (ὁ μεσίτης) of the cove-
nant, is described as standing between J ehovah on Sinai and
Israel on the plain below.

203. quo...] ‘howsoever (lit. ‘whithersoever’) the event
shall falls nec me ε ‘ nor shall any violence make me of my
free will swerve aside, no, not if it should hurl the land into
the sea, confounding them in a flood, and let loose heaven
into hell.’

206. ut] ‘ even as.' The passage is copied fron] the cath os
Achilles, Il. 1. 234:

ναὶ μὰ τόδε σκῆπτρον, τὸ μὲν οὔποτε φύλλα καὶ ὄζους
φύσει, ἐπεὶ δὴ πρῶτα τομὴν ἐν ὄρεσσι λέλοιπεν,

οὐδ’ ἀναθηλήσει· περὶ ’γὰρ ῥὰ ἑ χαλκὸς ἔλεψε

φύλλα τε καὶ φλοιόν’ νῦν αὖτέ μιν υἷες Ἀχαίων

ἐν παλάμῃ φορέουσι δικασπόλοι.

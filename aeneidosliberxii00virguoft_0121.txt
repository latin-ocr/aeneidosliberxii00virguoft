to stir their sense of shame. Cf. Il. 22. 415.

761. si quisquam adeat] ‘should any seek to approach
(Turnus).' quisquam is generally used only in negative sen-
tences, or sentences which are virtually negative; cf. 882,
auc quicqua77z...(lnlcemerit? ‘or will aught be sweet?':
‘nothing can be sweet'; Ecl. 9. 17, heu, cadit in quenquam
tantum sedus& ‘surely no one is so wicked.' Here the
order of Aeneas is in fact that not a man should stir.

7 62. excisurum...] For se omitted, cf. 654 n. saucius:

perpetually doubling on his track, and so seems to ‘ unwind'

Faunus is a strictly Italian deity, ‘the favourable god ' (faveo)
who guards shepherds, or ‘ the favourable spirit ' who, by his
whisperings among the trees, gives oracles (see Mommsen, Hist.
Rome, i. 176, 230) 3 but Virgil also makes him grandson of

only ‘ a Laurentiue deity ' (Laurenti divo), but also an actual
king of Laurentum.

768. dona]=votas vestes, 770. The sailors would make a
vow to their native deity that if they escaped shipwreck they

770. nullo discrimine] ‘making no distinction,’ ‘with no
regard (to its sanctity).' sacrum: masc„ see 208 n.

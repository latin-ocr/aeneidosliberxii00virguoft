40 VERG. AEN. XII.

23. manu] Cf. 627 n. necnon„.: ‘moreover Latinus has
gold and good will‚’ i.e. so as to satisfy your desires if your
own possessions do not suffice.

25. nec genus indecores] ‘of not ignoble birth'=0f very
noble birth: so, too, haud mollia is reallyz‘very hard.'
This rhetorical figure, called litotes (λιτότης, a making
smooth) or meiosis (μείωσις, a making less) is very frequent in
poetry; cf. 50, haud clebilez‘very strong' ; 763 229, haud
nescia, ‘well-versed'3 also 619 11.

26. simul hoc animo hauri] ‘therewith drink thou this
into thy sou],' i.e. take heed to it: cf. for hauri 94511. and
10. 648, animo spem ruo-bidus lzcmsit. But the intolerable
elision in the sixth foot has no parallel, and, if the words are
genuine, we must take llaec in line 25 of what Latinus has
already said in contrast with hoc which describes what he is
going to say, although such a contrast between haec and hoc
is almost impossible, while the ‘hard plain words' which
Latinus asks permission to utter are clearly those which
follow his request. Either this is the attempt of some gram-
marian to complete one of Virgil’s unfinished lines (cf. 631),
or it may be one of the ‘ props' (tibicines) which he is said to
have occasionally inserted to make up a line until he could
revise his work. Conington strangely leaves the line without
comment.

27. me natam ] The prohibition to give his daughter ‘to
any of her ancient suitors’ had been uttered by the oracle of
Faunus (588 7. 95 seq), which declared that she should wed a
foreign prince.

28. canebant] Oracles were always uttered in hexameter
verse, and so canere is constantly used 111 connection with
them=‘deelare⁷ or ‘foretelL' homines: i.e. augurs, sooth-
sayers, and the like.

29. cognato sang-uine] ‘ by ties of blood.' Venilia, mother
of Turnus, was sister to Amata, the wife of Latinus.

30. vincla omnia] i. e. as the next line shows the ‘bonds'
(l) of his plighted word and (2) of his obedience to the gods.

31. genero] i.e. Aeneas, to whom he had promised his
daughter, see Intr. p. xv. inpia: ‘unholy,’ because he was
resisting the declared will of heaven, cf. lines 27, 28, and
¹17). 58⁴} The hiatus in 9671er0‚· arma is aided by the pause ;

ut c . 53511.

342. hunc ...] ‘this one and that in close encounter, the
'former (i.e. Sthenelus) from afar ; from afar too (he slew) the
sons whom Imbrasus ....' congressu-s· is exactly=the adverb
comminus. The two forms of combat were either ‘hand to
hand’ (comminus; ef. 890) or eminus, ‘from a distance,' ie.
by the use of missiles.

344. nutrierat ] He had ‘ bred then] in Lycia, and decked
them with like arms, either to fight in close combat or to out-
strip the winds on horseback (i.e. orto charge 011 horseback).’
The infinitives cmzj'erre and praevertere are dependent on
nutrierat, which contains the thought ‘ had trained them,'
‘ had taught them t0,' and the intervening words, paribusque
ornaverat armzls’, do not affect the construction at all, but call
attention, in a touohing parenthesis, to the way 111 which the
fond father had (lecked the two youths ‘ in like armour’ only
to fall by a like death. So 6. 826, paribus armis: ‘like arms.’

Conington, almost following Servius, makes the infinitives
dependent on paribus, ‘ arms equally fitted either to join hand-
to-hand combat or to outstrip the winds‚' and quotes the very
ambiguous passage, Ecl. 7. 5, for the construction. But what
sort of arms would these be, and what arms could be paria
equo praevertere ventos?

347. antiqui] probably = ‘ of ancient lineage‚’ cf. 529. The
story of Dolon is told in Hom. Il. 10. 299 seq„ where he offers
to go and spy out (cf. 349) the Greek camp, if Hector will
promise him the horses of Achilles as his reward, but is
detected and slain by Diomede (= Tydides, 351).

348. nomine ] ‘in name recalling his grandsire, in spirit
and prowess (lit. ‘ the deeds of his hands ’) his parent.' In his-
torical Greece the naming of a person after his grandfather
was very frequent (cf. Arist. Av. 274, Ἱππόνικος Καλλίου κάξ

Ἰππονίκου Καλλίας).

350. ausus ...] ‘ had dared to claim as his reward the steeds of
Achilles ς’ cf. for currus, used of hol-ses, G. 1. 91, flsarcz's equi
biiuqes et maqni curru-s· Achillis ; 4. 389. Xanthus and Balius,
the horses of Achilles, were divine, cf. Hom. Il. 16. 148.

60 VERG. AEN. XII.

rapidity of style caused by the omission of the verbs, mark
that the act of Tolumnius, the shout‚ and the confusion were
almost simultaneous. Render—‘therewith at once a huge
shout rose, and ....'

269. cunei] the wedge-shaped sections into which the
semi-circle of seats in a theatre is cut by the gangways
(sec Dict. Ant. s.v. tloeatrum); here merely the ‘ranks’
of the spectators.

270. hasta ...] The long sentence is this—‘The spear, as
nine brothers stood opposite ...‚ of these one (273), a
youth (275) (it) pierces through the ribs (276).’ We must
break it up-‘ On sped the spear, while, as it befel, there
stood opposite the goodly forms of nine brethren, all of whom
one Tyrrheue wife had borne to Arcadian Gylippus. One of
these in the waist, where a youth conspicuous it pierces.'

273. horum] picks upfratrum. ad medium, ‘at the waist';
for neuter adj. used as subst„ cf. 42411. teritur ‘where
the belly is chased by the well—stitched bele, aud the buckle
clasps the joining of its ends.' virgil is copying Homer's
ὅθι ζωστῆρος ὀχῆες Ι χρυσεῖοι σύνεχον (Il. 4. 132, where see Leaf),
and the buckle is described as ‘ biting' the ends of the belt
where they join, because the action of a clasp is exactly like
that of biting. The balteus here is not a shoulder-belt, as in
942, but clearly passes round the waist tightly, so as to be
rubbed (cf. teritur) by the belly. Sidgwick, with Coning-
ton, gives ‘ grips closely the edges 01n the ribs‚' i.e. the lower
edges, just where the belt would buckle; but this explana-
tion seems totally to neglect the Latin.

275. iuvenem transadigit costas] The well-known
Homeric construction (σχῆμα καθ’ ὅλον καὶ μέρος) in which an
acc. of the person is followed by an acc. in apposition,
describing the place in which he is hit, shot, etc. Cf. 10.
698, Lamnum samo occupat 033 Il. 7. 14, Ἰφίνοον βάλε δουρὶ
ὦμον (‘ in the shoulder ').

277. fratres pars pars ...] The nominative is broken
up into its 'component parts-n‘But the brothers.. some
some’; cf. line 161 and Ecl. l. 65, at nos hinc alii...ibimus‚
pars veniemus (εὴμεῖς οἱ μέν οἱ δέ ,..).

281. Agymm] i.e. the men of Agylla. afterwards Caere, who
formed part of the rebellious Etrurians ; see 232 n.

82 VERG. AEN. XII.

606. laniata genas] ‘ tearing her cheeks.' This passage
shows not only the active force of the past part. pass. (see
172 n. ), but also that it is used in a strictly present sense3 cf.
11. 877, percussae pectora matres clamorem tollunt, ‘ raise
a wailing as they beat their breasts.’

in the two preceding paragraphs. caecis terroribus : ‘ with dark
dread,' i.e. with a feeling that something dreadful, which he
did not understand, had befallen.

619. inlaetabile] ‘joyless‚' a very strong word, which by

urge him to an opposite course.

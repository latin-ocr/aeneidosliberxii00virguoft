734. ignotum] ‘ strange‚' because the sword, as he now dis-
covers, was not his own. The next lines give the explanation.

735. praecipitem] ‘in his headlong haste.’ Notice the
excited alliteration of praecipitem, prima, proelia.

nothing,’ ‘ worthless.'

743. ‘and now hither then thither entwines wavering
circles'; incertos emphasizes the fact that he is hemmed in
and distracted, doubtful where to turn 3 cf. 752.

745. vasta palus] apparently the palu-s· Laurentia (10. 709)
famous for its boars.

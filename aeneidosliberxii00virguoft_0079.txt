NOTES. 51

143. scis ut. .] ‘thou knowest how I have preferred thee
alone above all Latin maids, who .'

144. ingratum] ‘ thankless‚⁷ because the union too often
brought only misery on the unhappy maiden. The epithet
‘high-souled' seems inconsistent here, and also 878, with the
cruelty with which Jupiter is charged, and Conington thinks
that it is used ‘ in a half-ironical sense,’ but more probably it
is a mere imitation of the epic style, in which heroes and gods
have always some stock epithet of distinction whatever their
conduct. So, as Ladewig points out, ‘ Achilles in one breath
addresses Agamemnon as κύδιστε and φιλοκτεανώτατε πάντων,’
and cf. Soph. Phil. 344, δῖός τ’ Ὀδυσσεύς, although the speaker
professes to hate hi1n3 while with us such phrases as ‘the
unfairness of the right honourable gentleman' or ‘ the ignor-
ance of my learned friend ² would not suggest sarcasm.

146. disce...] i.e. learn the grief that threatens you, so
that you may not afterwards blame me for not warning you
or seeking to prevent it.

147. qua ] ‘ where Fortune seemed to permit and (while)
the Fates allowed success to Latium I guarded, but now
(nunc, 149) .' qua z qua ria ; Juno used such path or means
as Fortune allowed ; with the next clause some such word as
quoad, ‘ as long as,’ must be supplied, as is shown by the anti-
thetica] nunc in 149. For cedere, cf. 185 n.

150. Parcarumque ] Cf. 11. 2'2. 212, ῥέπε δ”Ἐκτορος αἴσιμον
ἦμαρ, Ι ὤχετο δ’ εἷς Ἀΐδαο· λίπεν δέ ἑ Φοῖβος Ἀπόλλων. WVhen
the ‘day of doom‘ comes, the hero is left by his protecting
deity. Here ‚Juno adds that she must not only give way to
destiny‚ but that she could ‘not bear' (non possum=01>
τλήσομαι, Hom. Il. 3. 305) to look upon the battle.

151. foedera] i.e. all the preliminary arrangements as
described iu 160 seq.

152. praesentius] The adj. praesens is continually used of
deities who are ‘ present to assist' (eg. Ecl. 1. 41 ; Gr. 1. 10),
and then acquires the meaning of ‘effective,’ ‘efficacious’
(G. 2. 1273 3. 452) as here, or ‘potent‚’ ‘powerful’ in a
bad sense as line ⁶245. In no case, however, is the sense of
being actually ‘ present' or ‘at hand’ lost3 so here Juturna
will be actually ‘present' to assist, and in 245 the omen is
‘ present' before the eyes of the speotators.

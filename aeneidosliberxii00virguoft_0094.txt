66 VERG. AEN. XII.

351. alio ] ‘ repaid with a far different reward (i. e. death)
for such daring, and he has no ambition (i.e. now that he is
dead) for the horses of A.' ausis must refer back to ausus
and therefore describe, not so much the daring of his exploit
as his ‘ daring' (i.e. effrontery) in claiming the reward he had
done, and nec equis adspirat A. also marks his ambition as
exaggerated; Vix-gil, like Homer, here clearly disparaging
Dolon as too arrogant, although in 347, 348 he rather speaks
of him as a famous warrior. adficere aliquem poena, laude,
honoribus, and the like are common = ‘bestow punishment,
praise, dignities on any one?

353. hunc] i.e. Eumedes, the word resuming the narrative
after the digression about his father.

354. ante ...] ‘ first aiming at him with light javelin
through the long space between, theu cheeks his steeds .’
inane is used as a subst. (cf. 424 n.) = ‘space,' ‘empty
space,’ being a recollection of Lueretius, with whom it is a
technical word = ‘ void,’ τὸ κενόν. Cf. 906, vacuum per imme.
” The javelin hits Eumedes, cf. 356, but secutus cannot be
taken z ‘ reached, i. e. wounded ³ as some give.

356. semianimi] semi· (= ἡμι-) has e long, and the i is either
pronounced as y or vanishes altogether, the word being often
written semanimi& ; ef. semiermis or semermis, semiesas or
semesus.

l 3373 dextrae ] ⁴ wrests the sword from his (i.e. Eumedes⁷)
ian .

359. en...] ‘Lo! Trajan, lie there and measure out the
fields and that Western land thou didst seek in war?
Servius well notes that metire is used technically, metiuntur
enim (tyros qui colonis aestimant, and the Assrimensores (see
Dict. of Ant.) were a regular guild at Rome. Eumedes had
come to win a new land, and he was to have ‘two paces' of
it for his own. Cf. Soph. O. C. 790, χθονὸς λαχεῖν τοσοῦτον,
ἐνθανεῖν μόνον.

362. huic ] ‘ with him he sends Asbutes as his comrade,’ ‚

i.e. to the lower world.

363. cmoreaqffi Sybarimque] See 89 n.

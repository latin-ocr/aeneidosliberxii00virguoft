NOTES. 57

222. quem sermonem] ‘and when J uturna marked such
discourse spreading.' The previous lines only describe the
thosngylacs of the onlookers‚ but it is assumed that these
thoughts find expression in words.

226. etipse ,,.] Strict grammar would require ec qui ipse
erat acerrzmus.

227. dat sese] ‘ flings herself ’ ; cf. 383 n. haud nescia
rerum : ‘ well skilled (cf. 25 u.) in her task.'

228. serit] An admirable word. Runiours only need ⁴ sow-
ing' to spring up and bear fruit a hundredfold. Our phrase
‘ to propagate scanclal ⁷ is not dissimilar.

229. cunctis talibus] Both words are emphatic and corre.-
spond with numero and viribus in the next line. ‘ Is not all
such a host as this,' asks Juturna, ‘ a match for the foe alike
in numbers and in valour ‘3' talibus is deictic ; J uturna points
to the warriors around her.

231. omnes] emphatic—‘Lm these are all, all both the
Trojans and Arcadians and those fate-guided hosts of Etruria
arrayed against Turnus—yet scarcely, should but the half of
us join battle, (lo we find a foe⁷; i.e. all our foes together
cannot bring one man against our two.

232. fatalesque .,] The Etrurians (see p. xv.) were the
allies of Evander the Arcadian, and had driven out their
tyrant Mezentius, who had sought refuge with Turnus; but
they had been warned by the soothsayers that any attae-k on
Turnus would fail unless they obtained ‘a foreign leader'
(8. 499). Such a leader they had found in Aeneas, and they
therefore thought themselves secure ‘under the guidance of
fate' (cf. 11. 232, fatalem Aenean manufesto numine ferri).
The phrase fatale-5¹ manus is clearly contemptuous; the
Etruscans (qens dedica superstitionibus, Livy 5. 1) only dare
to face Turnus when they think themselves guarded by fate.

⁴234. me quidem...nos (236)] κεῖνος μέν ἡμεῖς δέ. The
omission of ‘but' in contrasted clauses in Latin is almost
regular ; the contrasted words, however, must be placed, as
here, in prominent and guitling position-s. ad. superos...:
‘shall be raised in fame to the gods and borne undying on
the lips of men’; i.e. he shall become one of those deified

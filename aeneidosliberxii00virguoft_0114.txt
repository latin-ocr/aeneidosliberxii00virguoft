86 VERG. AEN. XII.

659. tui fidissima] ‘most trustful in thee’3 the gen. is
objective, describing that on which confidence is placed. So
commonly fiducia with gen. : ⁶ trust in‚' and cf. meantis-sima,
studiosissima tui. Amata had placed all her trust in Turnus,
and, when she thought him dead (cf. 598), hung herself.
The rendering ‘thy truest friend‚' as though the words could

mean ‘in whom thou dost trust most‚' cannot be obtained
from the Latin.

663. strictisque...] ‘ and the harvest of steel bristles with
drawn blades.' Cf. 7. 526, atraque late Ι horrescit strictis seyes
ensibus ; Hom. ll. 13. 339, ἔφριξεν δὲ μάχη φθισίμβροτος
ἐγχείῃσιν. The compat-ison of a host with spears or swords
to a field of wheat with its bristling ears is natural and
obvious.

664. tu] emphatic and pointing the antithesis—⁶ they are
acting ; (but) thou ....'

665. varia...] ‘bewildered by the thought (or ‘picture')

‘seethe all together in his heart.' pudor: ‘shame‚' i.e. the
sense that his honour is at stake. mixtoque ε ‘and mad-
ness mingled with grief': grief stirs his passionate nature to
madness.

668. ambr et] Cf. 13 n. conscia virtus: ‘the consciousness
of worth' or ‘ valour.’

669. ‘when first the clouds were dispelled and light
dawned again upon his mind.' His recovery from the dark
storm of passion is compared to light breaking from the
clouds after a tenipest by a fine metaphor which is, in the
main, Virgil's own, although Lucr. 3. 304 has suffundens caeca
calissim‘s umbra (of anger), and Cat. 64. 207, caeca mentem
calissz'ne concitus (of grief).

672. flammis ] ‘ a rolling spire of flame (lit. ‘ rolling with
flame’) was whirling heavenwards from story to story, en-
folding a tower, the very tower which .'

675. rotas pontesque] In besiessinss towns, wooden towers
on wheels were regularly used, the various stoi-ies (tabulata)

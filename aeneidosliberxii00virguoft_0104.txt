509. Τ116 sentence is rather condensed and needs care in
rendering—‘ Turnus hurling from their steeds A. and his
brother D„ then attacking them on foot (i.e. dismounting
himself) strikes the one as he advances with his long spear,
the other with his sword.' Cf. Hom. Il. 20. 462, τὸν μὲν δουρὶ
βαλὼν, τὸν δὲ σχεδὸν ἄορι τύψας.

513. neci] with 722itcit=in necem, ‘hurls to destruction,²

a fisherrnan, and never sought to become the retainer of some
great and warlike chief. There is another reading, limina
(cf. Hor. Epod. 2. 8, superba civium Ι potentiorum limi⁷1.a):

xviii IN T RODUCTION.

compare ‘Chevy Chase' with the ‘Idylls of the
King.’ The one is a natural growth, the other
an artistic creation. The one describes men who
live and breathe as they appeared to men of like
passions in their own day3 the other attempts to
give animation to the ghosts of the past, and make
them interesting to men whose thoughts, tastes,
and tempere are wholly different. To the Homeric
story-teller and his hearers the story is the chief
thing and its literary form the second3 to Virgil
and his readers literary art is the first thing,
and the actual facts of the story are comparatively
unimportant.

Moreover, Virgil is unhappy in his hero. Com-
pared with Achilles his Aeneas is but the shadow
of a man.1 He is an abstraction typifying the
ideal Roman, in whom reverence for the gods
(pietas) and manly courage (virtus) combine, and
who therefore ultimately achieves what he aims at
in spite of ‘manifold mischances and all the risks
of fortune'.2 Indeed throughout the Aeneid he is
so regulated by ‘fate', visions, and superintending
deities that it is hard to take any real interest in¹
his acts and doings. But he is not only unreal

of the Round Table’ and ‘ the Doglas and the Persie', who

‘ Swapt together till they both swat
With swordes that were of fine myllan »’.

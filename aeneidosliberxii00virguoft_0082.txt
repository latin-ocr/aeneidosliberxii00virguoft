54 VERG. AEN. XII.

179. iam melior, iam...] ‘now‚ now at last kindlier, I
pray.' It is Juno's persistent hate which throughout the
poem causes all the missortunes of Aeneas3 cf. 1. 8-11, and
Introd., p. xiii.

181. fontesque fluviosque] Cf. 89 n. quaeque : ‘ all the
majestybf high Heaven,’ i.e. all the powers of the sky. He

183. cesserit ] ‘if victory shall perchance pass to Turnus.’
fors· and fors et (e. g. 11. 50, fors et vota facil) are often used
quite adverbially:‘perchance.' fors et vota facit may be
explained as parataxis, the two parallel clauses ‘there is
a chance and he is doing this' being used instead of ‘ there
is a chance that he is doing this'3 but where fors is used
alone all sense of such an origin of the idiom seems lost.

184. convenit] impersonally, ‘it is agreed.'

185. cedet] ‘ shall retire from‚' i. e. quit. Note the different
use of cedo with dat. in 183 Ξ ‘ pass to‚' ‘ pass into the hands
of‚' for which cf. 148, cedere res Latio, ‘that fortune should
pass to Latium,’ ‘that L. should prosper.'

187. sin...] ‘but if Victory shall grant us that the (issue
of the) combat be with us‚' i.e. that the field be ours. Mars =
is here ‘ the issue of the battle,⁷ as in such phrases as Marte
dubio, prospero, incerto, communi, adverso.

189. non ego nec nec] The negative is repeated for the
sake of great emphasis ; cf. Ecl. 4. 55 ; 5. 25. The con-
struction is regular in Greek (οὐκ ἐγὼ οὔτε οὔτε ) but rare
in Latin. Render, ‘Not mine shall it be to bid Italians be
subject to Trojans, nor seek I empire for myself.'

190. paribus] emphatic : he repudiates dominion, and only
seeks that ⁶ under equal law-s both unconquered peoples may
bring themselves into everlasting union.' These fine lines
were quoted by Pitt in advocating the union with Ireland.

192. sacra deosque] ⁴ holy things and gods ' 3 sacra includes
all rites and instruments of worship 3 deos refers especially to
the sacred fire of Vesta ancl the images of the Penates, Which
he had brought with him from Troy. socer arma imperium

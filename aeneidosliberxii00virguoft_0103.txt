500-553. Who could tell os all the slauslhter wroussht by
'l'urnu-s· and Aeneas? Hero after hero they slew, syrreadinss
kavoc with all the raye offire or flood. Aeneas ]zurls M urrann-s*
from his chariot ; Turnus kills Hyllus (mid Cretheus. Cupencus
sall-s, and Aeolus, whom the Greek-s· could noc 01·erco7ne,fimls α

scublaorn between both hosts.

500. quis mihi nunc ...] ‘and now, alas, what god could
unfold so many horrors, who (relate) in song ‘3' This passage
is sometimes misunderstood. Conington, for instance, iu his
translation gives, ‘ what god will tell me all those horrors and
relate for me in verse ?'; but, apart from the rendering of
expediat, ‘ will tell‚' who ever heard of a god relating anything
to or for a poet in verse? In reality (1) mihi has nothing to
do with the distant expediat, but is an ethic dative indicating
that the question he asks affects the poet deeply and per-
plexes him, and (2) (Zeus is not supplied with the second quie.
Overpowered by the thought of the tale of butchery which he
has before him, Virgil asks, ‘ What deity could unfold it, who
relate it in verse⁴2⁷ indicating that its horror is beyond what
divine power or human art can describe.

503. tanton⁵...] ‘was it thy pleasure, O Jupiter, that
peoples soon to live in everlasting peace should clash with
such a shock ’ἓ ’ For tanton = tantone, cf. 797, 874.

505. ‘Aeneas (meeting) the Rutulian Sucro—that eombat
first checked the Trojan onset—with brief delay smites him
in the side.' Hitherto the Trojan onset had been unresisted‚
but, when Sucro meets Aeneas, it is checked, although Sucro
cannot ‘long delay’ his assailant, who is ‘ready for him'
(excipit) and deals him a blow ‘in the side.’ eoecipere is
regularly used of hunters who are ready to receive game or
beasts which are driven to them, and so here excipit describes
Aeneas as ‘ready to receive' Sucro‘s approach. excipit in
lacu-s· is a sort of pregnant construction = ⁸ he receives (striking
him) in the side.’

507. qua fata celerrima] Cf. Il. 8. 84, ὅθι μάλιστα καίριόν
ἐστι, ‘at the place where death is speediest.' crudum:

probably almost = crudelem, ‘ the unpitying sword' ; cf.
Homer’s νηλέϊ χαλκῷ.

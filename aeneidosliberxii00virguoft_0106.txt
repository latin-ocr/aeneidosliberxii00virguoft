78 VERG. AEN. XII.

534. incita nec memorum] Nec is z et ozon, the ‘hoof'
being described as (1) galloping furiously, and (2) belonging
to steeds that remember not their master. In translating we
should omit the connecting ‘ and '—⁴ furiously the hoof of his
steeds that forget their master tramples him .'

535. Hylle animisque] Hiatus after long ο when the ictus
rests upon it occurs many times in Virgil3 cf. 313 7. 178,
cedro ΙίαΖΊι-ςᾳιιες 226, Oceano ἑὲ. For inmane frementi,
‘ raging horribly‚' cf. 398 n.

539. nec di ] ⁵ nor (lid the gods he served protect Cupen-
eus.⁷ Servius states that in the Sabine language Cupencus v
signifies a priest ; hence sui. He also notes the art with which
Virgil marks the superiority of Aeneas; valour cannot save
Cretheus from Turnus, but even the special protection os heaven
cannot protect Cupencus ‘ when Aeneas attacks.

541. mora] ‘ check ' or ‘ delay of his shield‚’ i.e. the shield
with which he sought to delay death. aerei ι two syllables by
synizesis (συνίζησις, ‘a sinking together⁷), and so commonly
with the oblique cases of words in -eus, cf. balta, 10. 496τ,
aure—a, l. 698 ; ferrei, 6. 280.

543. et late ] ⁴ and cover the earth with thy broad bulk.

546. ‘ Here didst thou find the goal of death: thy stately
dwelling was beneath Ida, at Lyrnesus thy stately dwelling, in
Laurentiue earth thy tombs mortis metae: Homer's θανάτοιο
τέλος, and commentators also quote Il. 20. 390, ἐνθάδε τοι
θάνατος· ’γενεὴ δέ τοί ἐστ’ ἐπὶ λίμνῃ 1 Γυγαίῃ for 547, while they
refer to 11. 20, 371, for the device of repeating domus alta3 but
the peculiar charm of these pathetie lines is wholly Virgil’s.
Lyrnesi : locative, the only instance of this use with the name
of a town in Virgil.

548. totae adeo ] ‘ The‘n the universal host met, both all
the Latius and all the Trojans.' adeo is frequently used in
Virgil as second word in a sentence to strongly emphasize the
first word3 cf. Ecl. 4. ll, teque adem 9. 59, hmo adeo, ‘just
from here' ; Gr. 1. 94, multum adeo ; 2. 323, ver adeo, ‘ spring,
yes spring ' ; Aen. 3. 203, tres adeo .. soles, ‘ three whole days;
4. 533, sic αάρος 6. 498, vix adeo. omnesque omnes, ‘ both
all and all.' Virgil is fond of thus omitting a second ec or

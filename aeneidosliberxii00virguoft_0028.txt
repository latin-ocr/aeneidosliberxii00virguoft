xxiv INTRODUCTION.

VI.

Thou that seesb Universal
Nature moved by Universal Mind 3

Thou majestie in thy sadness
at the doubtful doom of human kind ς

VII.

Light among the vanish'd ages ;
star tha‘o gildest yet this phantom shore 3

Golden branch amid the shadows,
kings and realms that pass to rise no more ;

VIII.

Now thy Forum roars no longer,

fallen every purple Caesar’s dome—-
Tho’ thine ocean-roll of rhythm

sound for ever of Imperial Rome—-

IX.
Now the Rome of slaves hath perish’d,
and the Rome of freemen holds her place,

I, from out the Northern Island
sunder'd once from all the human raee,

X.

1 salute thee, Mantovano,

Ι that loved thee since my day began,
Wielder of the stateliest measure

ever moulded by the lips of man.

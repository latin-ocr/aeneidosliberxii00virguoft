84 VERG. AEN. XII.

641. occidit] thrown prominently forward for emphasis and
also to balance oppetere—‘Dead, too, lest he should behold
my shame, is unhappy Ufens.’ infelix: in contrast with
7. 745, U fem, insinuem fama et felicibus armi-s· ne might be
consecutive, ‘so that he did not see‚' but the bitterness of the
lauguage demands that it should have a final sense, as though
Ufens died ‘in order that he might not see' the disgrace of
Turnus.

642. Teucri ...] In Homer the last disgrace which can befall
a warrior is that his body and arms should pass into the
possession of the foe. Hence the continual combats described

over the body, μὴ ἀπὸ τεύχε’ ἕλωνται, ἀεικίσσωσι δὲ νεκρόν
(Il. l6. 545; of. 16. 751 seq„ 17. l seq).

643. id unum] parenthetical ε ‘ that only was wanting to
my fortunes,' i.e. to crown my missortunes.

644. nec dextra ] ‘ and shall I not with my sword refute
the sneers of Drances ⁴? ' Notice the rhetorical antithesis
between dextra and dicta. Drances had made a bith attack
on Turnus oharging him with cowardice in refusing to meet

Aeneas, 11. 336 seq.
645. haec] emphatic ε ‘ this ² = my native land.

646. Manes] the Di Mane& the powers of the world below,
including the spirits of the departed, whom he was about to
Jom.

647. ‘be ye gracious, seeing that the good-will of the gods
above (lit. ‘ their good-will to the gods ’) is turned away from
me.’ Many with good authority read adversa, and cf. such
phrases as Livy l. 46, adversa. patrum volunta-33 but the dat.
Superis is awkward next to adversa, which does not govern it.

648. anima Ι atque] The lengthening of the short α, even
though the ictus is on it, is unparalleled, and the hiatus makes
the license more striking. The text, however, is certain, and
the splendid line needs no defence. It is spoken with slow
deliberation and with a dramatic pause after anima. Munro's
suggestion to read sancta ad fios anima, α ! atque gives an
intolerable line, but shows a recognition of the fact that there
is a strong emotional eheck before atque. Some would scan
istm& inscia, but the lengthening of us in thesis (i.e. where the
ictus is not on it) is also without parallel, and the sound of the
resulting line extremely harsh.
